        This is the repository I use to carry out toy hacking with forms and editing HTML 
        technologies in order to figure out ideas as to what can be done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Current experiments include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href='cursed.html'>cursed</a> â€” minimal primitive for cursors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Feedback is welcome on anything you might find here. Don't use anything you find in
        production unless you really know what you're doing.
